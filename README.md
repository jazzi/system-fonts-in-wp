# system-fonts-in-wp

A plugin for WordPress that replaces Open Sans with your device's standard system fonts.

There are other plugins that remove Open Sans, but they rely on the generic `sans-serif` fallback. This one adds a new stylesheet that specifies the system UI font for most major operating systems.

This is based on the approach we developed for WordPress.com and Calypso. For more background, see: http://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/3016

**Disclaimer:** I never claimed to know what I was doing; if your site is hacked by pirates after installing this plugin, it's not my fault.
